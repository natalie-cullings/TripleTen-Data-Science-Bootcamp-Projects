| 4 | Software Development Tools |[Car Sales Advertisement Dashboard (Streamlit Web App)](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_04-Software_Development_Tools) | The project task was to build an interactive web app dashboard that can be used to explore data related to vehicle sales advertisements. Here's the link to the [Render-hosted web app](https://car-sales-ads-dashboard.onrender.com/) as well. |
| 5 | Integrated Project # 1 |[Identify Patterns That Drive the Success of Video Games](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_05-Integrated_Project_1) | The project task was to analyze international video game sales to identify factors that drive game success for Ice, a hypothetical video game e-comm store, which will support planning for their upcoming advertising campaigns.|
| 6 | Data Collection & Storage (SQL and HTTP Web Requests) |[Chicago Taxi Market Analysis](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_06-Data_Collection_and_Storage) | The project task was to collect data about the taxi market via HTTP web requests and SQL and analyze the resulting data set to understand top taxi company operators,  most popular neighborhoods customers take rides to, and how weather and date conditions affect ride duration. |
| 7 | Machine Learning Basics |[Phone Subscription Plan Recommendation Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_07-Machine_Learning_Basics) | The project task was to develop a machine learning model that would analyize the behavior of legacy plan subscribers at the hypothetical mobile carrier company Megaline and recommend one of Megaline's newer Smart or Ultra plans. |
| 8 | Supervised Learning |[Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_08-Supervised_Learning) | The project task was to predict whether the hypothetical company Beta Bank's customers will churn based on their past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. |
| 9 | Machine Learning in Business |[Oil Well Reserve Volume Prediction Model & Profit Optimization](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_09-Machine_Learning_in_Business) | The project task was to build a machine learning model to predict the volume of oil reserves in potential new wells for the hypothetical oil mining company OilyGiant, determine the oil wells with the highest estimated reserve volume, and finally pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells. |
| 10 | Real-world Data Science Problem (Integrated Project #2) | [Gold Recovery from Gold Ore Purification Process Prediction & Optimization Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_10-Integrated_Project_2) | The project task was to build a machine learning model to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore for the real industrial technology company [Zyfra](https://www.zyfra.com/ru/). The model will help to optimize the amount of gold recovered and eliminate unprofitable parameters. |
| 11 | Linear Algebra |[Practical Application of Linear Algebra Case Study](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_11-Linear_Algebra) | The project task was to solve several machine learning regression and classification tasks for the hypothetical insurance company Sure Tomorrow utilizing operations with matrices and vectors, the creation of machine learning classes, linear regression, and data obfuscation. |
| 12 | Numerical Methods |[Market Value of a Car Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_12-Numerical_Methods) | The project task was to utilize gradient boosting to build a machine learning model that predicts the market value of a car for the new app that the hypothetical company Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing. |
| 13 | Time Series |[Taxi Order Demand Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_13-Time_Series) | The project task was to build a machine learning model for the hypothetical company Sweet Lift Taxi that predicts the amount of taxi orders for the next hour in order to attract more drivers during peak hours. |
| 14 | Machine Learning for Texts |[Movie Review Sentiment Classification Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project_14-Machine_Learning_for_Texts) | The project task was to build a machine learning model with polarity labeling for the hypothetical company Film Junky Union that classifies positive and negative movie reviews. |
| 15 | Computer Vision | [Convolutional Neural Network Age Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Project%2015%20-%20Computer%20Vision) | The project task was to build a machine learning model for the hypothetical supermarket chain company Good Seed that verifies the age of customers purchasing alcohol from images of their faces to help Good Seed adhere to laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol to underage individuals. |
| 17 | Integrated Project #3 | [Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/natalie-cullings/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint%2017%20-%20Integrated%20Project%203) | The project task was to build a machine learning model for the hypothetical telecom operator company Interconnect that both predicts customer churn and identifies which factors are most likely to drive churn so they can offer promotional codes and special plan options to the customers with the highest risk of leaving. |
